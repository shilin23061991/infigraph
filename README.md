## The Problem

AI agents are **structurally blind** to your codebase. When they need to answer "who calls this function?" or "what breaks if I change this class?", they have to re-read files, retrace imports, and re-infer relationships — wasting time and tokens.

![The Hidden Cost of Code Blindness in the Age of AI](https://learnbyinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/06/hidden-cost-ai-infigraph.png)

**The cost:** 60–80% of AI agent tokens spent on code rediscovery instead of solving your problem.

## Why Infigraph (What Makes It Unique)

The market has two categories of solutions — neither solves this:

**Cloud-based tools** (GitHub Copilot, Sourcegraph, Codeium, Tabnine):
- ❌ Require sending your code to external APIs
- ❌ Expensive per-query (token costs compound)
- ❌ Latency-bound by network round-trips
- ❌ Privacy concerns for proprietary code
- ✅ Good AI integration

**Local analysis tools** (ctags, Language Servers, ripgrep, CodeQL):
- ✅ Run locally, offline-capable
- ✅ No privacy/security concerns
- ❌ No persistent knowledge graph
- ❌ Limited language support (1-3 languages)
- ❌ Not designed for AI agents
- ❌ Scattered results, high token overhead for agents

**The gap Infigraph fills:**
| Feature | Cloud Tools | Local Tools | Infigraph |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Local-first operation** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Persistent knowledge graph** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **62 language support** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **AI agent integration** (MCP) | Limited | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Offline operation** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **No external APIs** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Cypher queries on code** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Cross-file resolution** | ❌ | Limited | ✅ |

**No other product or OSS combines all of these.** Infigraph is the first AI-native, local-first knowledge graph engine for code.

---

## The Solution

Infigraph builds a **persistent knowledge graph** of your codebase before the agent runs. Structural questions that would cost hundreds of tokens to answer with raw file reads now resolve in milliseconds:

```
Source Code (62 languages)
    ↓
Infigraph Index (one-time, < 1min for most projects)
    ↓
Knowledge Graph (symbols, calls, imports, routes, patterns)
    ↓
AI Agent Queries (instant, precise, token-efficient)

Examples:
  "Search for auth logic" → 10-100x fewer tokens
  "Who calls validate_user?" → 1ms instead of 5s file reads
  "Blast radius of this change?" → Complete call graph traversal
```

---

## Key Highlights
- **62 Languages:** Tree-sitter parsing for 62 languages + ANTLR grammar plugins for custom DSLs. Zero config.
- **Graph Database:** Full Cypher queries on your codebase — WITH, OPTIONAL MATCH, variable-length paths.
- **Semantic Search:** BM25 + Model2Vec hybrid search. Finds "retry logic" even if the function isn't named retry.
- **SCIP Integration:** Auto-downloads compiler-grade indexers (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C#, Ruby, Scala). Falls back to lsp-to-scip bridge for 14+ more languages.
- **Cross-File Resolution:** Import-aware call resolution links function calls to actual definitions across files.
- **HTTP Route-Aware:** Maps your API surface across 22 frameworks (Flask, Express, Spring, Actix, Phoenix, Rails, etc.).
- **Multi-Repo/Microservice:** Group repos, cross-repo Cypher queries, HTTP contract extraction, cross-service dependency detection.
- **PR Review & CI:** Auto-detects PR type (bug fix, refactor, migration, feature) and scope. Runs semantic diff, blast radius, affected tests, security scan, complexity, dead code, clones — with optional LLM-enriched test plan and risk assessment. Cross-repo blast radius via groups. Configurable CI check gates.
- **Test Context Generator:** `get_test_coverage` identifies untested symbols per file. `review` surfaces affected tests for changed code. Together they generate test context for AI agents writing tests.
- **OSV Vulnerability Scanning:** Scans dependencies against the OSV database for known vulnerabilities.
- **Context Compression:** Automatic 70-90% token reduction on tool outputs. Budget-aware scaling, session dedup, quality monitoring with per-tool safety caps.
- **Design Pattern Detection:** Identifies Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Builder, and other patterns.
- **Refactor Analysis:** Complexity hotspots, coupling, near-duplicate detection, dead code — ranked by impact/effort.
- **Taint Analysis:** Intra + inter-procedural dataflow tracking from sources (HTTP params, user input) to sinks (SQL, exec, file I/O). Sanitizer-aware.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Detects authorization, caching, transactions, rate limiting, audit logging, and more from annotations across 7 languages.
- **Config Binding Resolution:** Parses Spring profiles, Django settings, .NET appsettings, Rails envs — links conditional annotations to config properties.
- **Reflection Scanner:** Detects `Class.forName`, `importlib.import_module`, dynamic `require` — resolves targets via config files.
- **Document Indexing:** Index PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, Markdown with hybrid search.
- **Confluence Wiki Crawler:** BFS wiki crawl with incremental sync — indexes pages into the same search pipeline as code.
- **Auto-Watch:** File watcher auto-starts after indexing. Index stays fresh without manual intervention.
- **HNSW Vector Index:** Approximate nearest neighbor search for fast similarity queries at scale (~2ms for 500K symbols).
- **Session Continuity:** Persists context across AI agent sessions — summary, pending tasks, decisions, touched files.
- **[LM2 Memory System](docs/LM2.md):** Session-aware memory with confidence decay, auto-injection, and consolidation. Tools: `memory_context` (intelligent context gathering), `consolidate_memory` (merge related sessions).
- **Search Performance:** BM25 disk cache + binary HNSW sidecar for 16x faster MCP repeat searches (3.68s→223ms) and 2x faster CLI (4.3s→2.08s).
- **82 MCP Tools:** Full AI agent integration for 11 coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.).
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Auto-generates Mermaid sequence diagrams from call graphs.
- **Cross-Language Detection:** Delphi↔COM, VB6↔COM, C#↔JNI, FFI, gRPC, WASM bridges.
- **Grammar Plugins:** Drop `.g4` + `plugin.toml` — parse any custom/internal DSL without Rust compilation.
- **[Pipeline Plugins](docs/PIPELINE_PLUGINS.md):** Runtime-extensible pipeline metadata extraction — add new data pipeline formats (dbt, Airflow, custom) without recompiling. Dependency graphs, impact analysis, compliance queries.
- **Structured Ingestion:** TOML schema-driven plug-n-play data ingestion — define schemas in `.infigraph/structured-schemas/`, drop JSON/YAML data files. Symbol resolution, directory mode, dual backend.
- **Named Sessions:** Save and recall named AI agent sessions by identity — persist context across long-running projects.
- **Write-Lock Safety:** Advisory file locking for Kuzu single-writer constraint. All write paths protected. RAII guard auto-releases on drop or crash.
- **Web UI:** Built-in graph explorer, search, route map at localhost:9749.
- **Export:** Neo4j Cypher, GraphML, JSON — take your graph anywhere.

## Quick Start

### Install (one-liner)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intuit/infigraph/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intuit/infigraph/main/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

### Index your project
```bash
cd /path/to/project
infigraph index
```

### Ask your AI agent
```
"Who calls the validate_user function?"
"Show me the blast radius of this change"
"Find authentication logic in this codebase"
"What's the architecture of this project?"
```

Infigraph auto-indexes on first query. No manual setup needed for Claude Code, Cursor, or other AI agents with MCP support.

---

## How It Works

### With Claude Code (Recommended)
After install, start using Claude Code normally. Infigraph indexes your project automatically and transparently:

```
> You: "Search for authentication logic"
> Claude: [Scans via Infigraph, returns precise results with 60-80% fewer tokens]
```

No CLI commands. No separate indexing step. Just ask.

### With Other AI Agents
Any agent with MCP support (Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Windsurf, etc.) gets 69 Infigraph tools automatically after `infigraph install`.

### Manual CLI (Optional)
```bash
infigraph search "auth"                    # Hybrid search
infigraph query "MATCH (...)"              # Cypher queries
infigraph trace-callers "function_name"   # Who calls this?
infigraph dead-code                        # Find unused functions
infigraph impact "auth.py::authenticate"   # Blast radius
```

---

## Offline-First Design

Infigraph is **built for offline operation** — everything runs locally, no cloud APIs or network access needed. The ML embedding model (`potion-base-8M`, 29MB) is bundled in this repository for immediate use without additional downloads.

This means:
- Semantic search works out of the box after cloning
- No external dependencies or API keys required
- Your codebase never leaves your machine
- Works on air-gapped systems

## Remote MCP (HTTP Transport)

Serve Infigraph as a **remote MCP server** over HTTP, giving your entire team access to the code intelligence graph without local setup.

```bash
# Start HTTP server (default port 8642)
infigraph-mcp --serve

# Custom port + API key auth
INFIGRAPH_API_KEY=your-secret infigraph-mcp --serve --mcp-port=9000

# Combine with stdio MCP (serve both transports)
infigraph-mcp --mcp --serve
```

### Connect from Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json` or project `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "infigraph": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "http://<server>:8642/tools/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/tools/mcp` | MCP JSON-RPC (initialize, tools/list, tools/call) |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

### Auth

Set `INFIGRAPH_API_KEY` on the server. Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. If no key is set, the server is open.

---

## Multi-Repo Remote Mode

Index **30+ repositories** into a shared Neo4j graph with Postgres metadata — all running as sidecar containers in the same pod. Zero external dependencies.

```bash
# Build with remote backend support
cargo install infigraph-cli --features remote

# Set environment
export INFIGRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j
export NEO4J_URI=127.0.0.1:7687
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=infigraph
export DATABASE_URL="host=localhost user=infigraph password=infigraph dbname=infigraph"

# Index repos into shared graph
infigraph group create my-org
infigraph group build my-org    # parallel indexing via rayon
```

**What changes in remote mode:**
- Code graph → Neo4j (concurrent writes, shared across repos)
- Registry/sessions → Postgres (persistent across container restarts)
- Search/semantic_search → Neo4j symbols + pgvector embeddings (brute-force vector scoring)
- Namespace prefixing prevents collisions (`svc-auth/src/main.rs` vs `svc-gateway/src/main.rs`)
- Group build indexes repos in parallel (Kùzu is sequential)

See **[docs/REMOTE-MULTI-REPO.md](docs/REMOTE-MULTI-REPO.md)** for full architecture, setup, and configuration.

## Installation

### System Requirements

| Platform | Required |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | Rust (rustup), `brew install cmake` |
| Linux | Rust (rustup), `sudo apt install cmake` |
| Windows | Rust (rustup), Visual Studio Build Tools (C++20) |

**No Docker, no Python, no Node.js required** — everything is self-contained.

### From crates.io (recommended)

```bash
cargo install infigraph-cli infigraph-mcp
infigraph install
```

Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and `cmake`.

### macOS / Linux (one-liner)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intuit/infigraph/main/install.sh | bash
```

This:
- Downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub releases (if available)
- Falls back to cloning + `cargo build --release` (installs Rust if needed)
- Adds `infigraph`, `infigraph-mcp`, and `lsp-to-scip` to `~/.local/bin`
- Registers MCP server for all 11 AI coding agents
- Writes primary search instructions to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

> **System dependency:** `cmake` is required to build the graph database.
> Install before building: `brew install cmake` (macOS) or `sudo apt install cmake` (Linux).

### Windows

Run this single command from **PowerShell**:

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intuit/infigraph/main/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

This downloads and runs the full installer — which fetches the pre-built binary and registers the MCP server.

## Update

Re-run the installer to pull latest and rebuild:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intuit/infigraph/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or if building manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/infigraph && git pull && cargo build --release
infigraph update
```

`infigraph update` re-registers MCP server paths and refreshes CLAUDE.md instructions.

Infigraph also checks for updates in the background (once per 24h) and prints a hint when a newer version is available.

## Uninstall

```bash
infigraph uninstall
```

Removes:
- MCP server config from all 11 AI agents
- Primary search instructions from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Does NOT delete the binary — remove `~/.local/bin/infigraph` and `~/.local/bin/infigraph-mcp` manually if desired.

---

## Usage Examples

### Indexing

The first time you run Infigraph on a project, it indexes all source files and builds the knowledge graph:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
infigraph index              # Builds graph (~30s–2min depending on size)
infigraph index --full       # Clean rebuild from scratch
```

### Common Tasks

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| **Search** | `infigraph search "auth logic"` |
| **Who calls this?** | `infigraph trace-callers "function_name"` |
| **What does this call?** | `infigraph trace-callees "function_name"` |
| **Blast radius** | `infigraph impact "file.py::function"` |
| **Dead code** | `infigraph dead-code` |
| **Routes/endpoints** | `infigraph routes` |
| **Cypher query** | `infigraph query "MATCH (s:Symbol) RETURN s.name"` |
| **Architecture** | `infigraph architecture` |
| **Design patterns** | `infigraph detect-patterns` |
| **Export** | `infigraph export json --output graph.json` |

### Web UI

Infigraph includes a built-in graph explorer at `http://localhost:9749/?path=/your/project`:

```bash
infigraph-mcp --ui --port=9749
# Opens interactive graph explorer, search, route map
```

---

## Features & Architecture

### Grammar Plugins (ANTLR)

Infigraph supports runtime-loaded ANTLR grammar plugins. Drop `.g4` grammar files + a `plugin.toml` config into a directory — infigraph parses the language automatically via a JVM subprocess. **No Rust compilation needed.**

### Quick start: adding a new language

1. Create a grammar plugin directory:
   ```
   ~/.infigraph/grammars/my-lang/
   ├── MyLang_Lexer.g4      # ANTLR lexer grammar
   ├── MyLang_Parser.g4     # ANTLR parser grammar
   └── plugin.toml          # Extension mapping + extraction rules
   ```

2. Write `plugin.toml`:
   ```toml
   [language]
   name = "my-lang"
   extensions = [".ml", ".myl"]
   entry_rule = "program"
   lexer = "MyLang_Lexer.g4"
   parser = "MyLang_Parser.g4"
   strip_preprocessor = false   # true if files have #include/#ifdef lines

   [[entities]]
   rule = "functionDecl"        # ANTLR parser rule name
   kind = "Function"            # Symbol kind (Function, Method, Class, Variable, etc.)
   name_child = "identifier"    # Child rule that holds the name
   scope = true                 # Creates a scope (section/function boundary)

   [[entities]]
   rule = "classDecl"
   kind = "Class"
   name_child = "identifier"
   scope = true

   [[relations]]
   rule = "functionCall"
   kind = "Calls"
   target_child = "identifier"

   [[relations]]
   rule = "fieldAccess"
   kind = "Reads"
   target_child = "fieldName"
   condition = "has_token:."    # Only match when DOT token is present
   ```

3. Index your project — infigraph discovers the plugin automatically:
   ```bash
   infigraph -r /path/to/project index
   ```

### Plugin discovery

Plugins are loaded from two locations:
- `~/.infigraph/grammars/*/plugin.toml` — user-level (all projects)
- `<project>/grammars/*/plugin.toml` — project-level (per repo)

Project-level plugins take precedence.

### Requirements

- **Java 11+** — the ANTLR interpreter runs in a JVM subprocess
- **No Rust toolchain needed** — grammar plugins are pure config + `.g4` files

### How it works

```
plugin.toml + .g4 files
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────┐     stdin/stdout JSON     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Rust host       │ ◄──────────────────────► │  JVM subprocess   │
│  (infigraph)     │                          │  (ANTLR interp.)  │
│                  │  1. Load grammar          │                   │
│  Discovers       │  2. Parse file            │  Grammar.load()   │
│  plugin.toml     │  3. Get parse tree JSON   │  ParserInterpreter│
│  Walks tree      │                          │                   │
│  → Symbol/Rel    │                          │                   │
└─────────────────┘                          └──────────────────┘
```

1. **Startup**: infigraph scans plugin directories, spawns a single persistent JVM process
2. **Load**: sends `.g4` grammar paths to the JVM driver, which loads them in ANTLR interpreter mode
3. **Parse**: for each source file, sends content to JVM, receives JSON parse tree
4. **Extract**: Rust walks the JSON parse tree using `plugin.toml` entity/relation rules, produces `Symbol` + `Relation` objects
5. **Graph**: extracted data flows into the same graph/search/analysis pipeline as all other languages

### Grammar imports

If your grammar uses `import` (e.g., `import Base_Lexer;`), place the imported `.g4` file in the same plugin directory. ANTLR resolves imports from the grammar file's directory.

### Extraction rule reference

#### Entity mappings (`[[entities]]`)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `rule` | yes | ANTLR parser rule name to match |
| `kind` | yes | `Function`, `Method`, `Class`, `Struct`, `Variable`, `Constant`, `Section`, `Module`, `Field`, `Test`, `Route` |
| `name_child` | yes | Child rule that holds the entity name |
| `scope` | no | If `true`, pushes a scope (nested symbols get `parent::name` IDs) |

#### Relation mappings (`[[relations]]`)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `rule` | yes | ANTLR parser rule name to match |
| `kind` | yes | `Calls`, `Imports`, `Reads`, `Writes`, `Inherits`, `Implements`, `Contains` |
| `target_child` | yes | Child rule that holds the target name |
| `condition` | no | `has_child:RULE`, `has_token:TEXT` — only match when condition is true |

### Performance

Grammar plugins use the ANTLR interpreter (no code generation). Slower than native tree-sitter but requires zero compilation:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| JVM cold start + grammar load | ~450ms (once) |
| Per-file parse (100 lines) | ~90ms |
| Per-file parse (500 lines) | ~770ms |
| 55-file batch | ~18s (324ms/file avg) |

The JVM stays alive for the duration of the infigraph session — subsequent parses only pay the per-file cost.

### Architecture: tree-sitter vs grammar plugins

| | Tree-sitter | Grammar Plugin |
|---|---|---|
| Grammar format | `.scm` queries | `.g4` grammars |
| Runtime | Native (compiled C) | JVM subprocess (ANTLR interpreter) |
| Adding a language | Write `.scm` query files | Drop `.g4` + `plugin.toml` |
| Compilation needed | No (queries are text) | No (interpreter mode) |
| Performance | ~1ms/file | ~100-800ms/file |
| Best for | Mainstream languages | Custom/internal DSLs |

Both backends produce the same `Symbol` + `Relation` output. Everything downstream (graph, search, analysis, MCP tools) is backend-agnostic.

## Pipeline Plugins

Runtime-extensible pipeline metadata extraction — add new data pipeline formats (dbt, Airflow, custom) without recompiling. Each plugin is a subprocess with JSON IPC.

**[Full Pipeline Plugins Guide →](docs/PIPELINE_PLUGINS.md)**

Quick overview:
- Drop a `plugin.toml` + extractor binary in `~/.infigraph/pipelines/<name>/` or `<project>/pipelines/<name>/`
- Infigraph auto-discovers plugins, detects matching documents, extracts metadata via subprocess
- Shared `PipelineCore` table enables cross-plugin dependency graphs and impact analysis
- 5 MCP tools: `pipeline_plugins`, `pipeline_deps`, `pipeline_impact`, `pipeline_compliance`, `pipeline_query`

## Test Context Generator

Generate framework-aware test scaffolds from your code graph. `generate_test_context` finds untested symbols, ranks them by caller count, and returns source + callers + callees + framework-specific templates — everything needed to write tests without guessing.

- **18 frameworks**: Rust, pytest, unittest, JUnit, TestNG, Jest/Vitest, Mocha, Playwright/Cypress, Karate, Go, NUnit/xUnit/MSTest, Kotlin/Kotest, ScalaTest, RSpec, Minitest, XCTest, ExUnit, Cucumber
- **4 test types**: unit, integration, functional, e2e
- **Auto-detection**: scans `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, etc. to pick the right framework
- **Style matching**: uses existing tests in your repo as style reference before falling back to templates

```
generate_test_context(path="/your/project", file="src/auth.py", test_type="unit")
```

**[Full Test Context Guide →](docs/TEST_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md)**

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

| Platform | Required |
|----------|---------|
| macOS | `brew install cmake`, Rust (`rustup`) |
| Linux | `sudo apt install cmake`, Rust (`rustup`) |
| Windows | Rust (`rustup`), Docker (for cross-compilation) |

### macOS (native — ARM64 or x86_64)

```bash
brew install cmake
git clone https://github.com/intuit/infigraph.git
cd infigraph
cargo build --release -p infigraph-cli -p infigraph-mcp
cp target/release/infigraph target/release/infigraph-mcp ~/.local/bin/
infigraph install
```

### Linux (x86_64 or ARM64)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake
git clone https://github.com/intuit/infigraph.git
cd infigraph
cargo build --release -p infigraph-cli -p infigraph-mcp
cp target/release/infigraph target/release/infigraph-mcp ~/.local/bin/
infigraph install
```

### Windows (native build)

Build natively on a Windows machine. **Cross-compiling from macOS is not currently supported** — LadybugDB (lbug) requires C++20 `<format>` (GCC 13+), but available cross-compilation Docker images ship GCC 9.

```powershell
# Install Rust
winget install Rustlang.Rustup

# Install CMake (required by lbug graph DB)
winget install Kitware.CMake

# Install Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/intuit/infigraph.git
cd infigraph
cargo build --release -p infigraph-cli -p infigraph-mcp

# Binaries at:
#   target\release\infigraph.exe
#   target\release\infigraph-mcp.exe
```

### Cross-compiling macOS targets on ARM64 machine

```bash
# Add Intel target
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin

# Build for Intel Mac (from ARM64 machine)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin -p infigraph-cli -p infigraph-mcp
```

### Releasing a new version (maintainers)

The `release.sh` script builds, signs, packages with the bundled model, and uploads to GHE releases:

```bash
./release.sh v1.0.0
```

What it does:
1. Builds `aarch64-apple-darwin` targets (Intel commented out — add when needed)
2. Ad-hoc signs both binaries with `codesign --sign -` (no Apple Developer cert required)
3. Packages `infigraph`, `infigraph-mcp`, and `models/` into `infigraph-<target>.tar.gz`
4. Creates a GitHub release at `github.com/intuit/infigraph` and uploads the archive

**Requirements:** `gh` CLI authenticated with `github.com`, `cmake`, Rust toolchain

## Setup as Primary Search

After install, register Infigraph as the primary search engine for all AI coding agents:

```bash
infigraph install
```

This does four things:
1. **Registers `infigraph-mcp`** as an MCP server for 11 agents: Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Zed, OpenCode, Aider, Windsurf, Kiro, GitHub Copilot
2. **Writes primary search instructions** to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so AI agents prefer Infigraph over raw grep/glob
3. **Installs Claude Code hooks** — enforcement hook (warns on raw search) + session save hooks (auto-save context on compaction)
4. **Configures Claude Code allowlist** — adds all Infigraph MCP tools to `~/.claude/settings.local.json` permissions

Then index your projects:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
infigraph index
# Full reindex (clean rebuild from scratch):
infigraph index --full
```

Every search, symbol lookup, and code navigation now goes through Infigraph's graph — saving 60-80% of tokens versus raw file reads.

## Web UI

Infigraph includes a built-in web UI for visual code exploration.

**It starts automatically** when the MCP server launches — open it at:

```
http://localhost:9749/?path=/your/project
```

The UI is served by the same `infigraph-mcp` process Claude Code spawns. No separate process needed.

**Multiple Claude sessions:** the first session to start binds port 9749 and serves the UI. All subsequent sessions skip the port bind silently and still get full MCP tool access. The UI stays up as long as at least one session is open.

**From Claude:** ask Claude to open the UI — it can launch a browser or give you the URL for your indexed project.

## Context Compression

MCP tool outputs are compressed automatically to cut agent token use (~70–90%). Fresh install defaults to `summary`. Full design, evals, and edge cases: [docs/CONTEXT-COMPRESSION.md](docs/CONTEXT-COMPRESSION.md).

### Compression levels

| Level | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `off` | Debugging / need raw tool output |
| `summary` | Default — structured summaries, results kept |
| `aggressive` | Shorter summaries, fewer callers/callees |
| `minimal` | One-liners / counts only |
| `auto` | Scales Off → Summary → Aggressive → Minimal as the session token budget fills |

**Config** (`.infigraph/config.toml` or `~/.infigraph/config.toml`):

```toml
[compression]
enabled = true
level = "summary"          # off | summary | aggressive | minimal | auto
token_budget = 150000      # used when level = "auto"
dedup = true
ml_compression = "extractive"  # extractive | kompress | off
```

**Environment** (overrides config):

```bash
export INFIGRAPH_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=aggressive   # off | summary | aggressive | minimal
export INFIGRAPH_TOKEN_BUDGET=150000            # for level=auto
export INFIGRAPH_DEDUP=0                        # disable session dedup
```

Use `detail=true` on tools (e.g. `search`, `get_doc_context`) when you need full uncompressed output for that call. `get_compression_stats` reports the active level and savings.

### Optional: kompress (ML prose compression)

Default prose path is fast extractive summarization. To use **kompress-small** (ONNX, ~275MB, downloaded on first use to `~/.infigraph/models/kompress-small/`):

```toml
[compression]
ml_compression = "kompress"
```

```bash
export INFIGRAPH_ML_COMPRESSION=kompress
# optional: export INFIGRAPH_KOMPRESS_DIR=/path/to/kompress-small
```

Requires a build with the `kompress` Cargo feature (default on most release targets; Intel Mac release builds may omit it). If the model download or inference fails, Infigraph falls back to extractive compression.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP tools not available in Claude Code

**Symptom:** `mcp__infigraph__*` tools appear as "deferred" in ToolSearch but aren't active, or Claude says Infigraph isn't loaded.

**Most common cause:** A project-level `.claude/settings.json` with an `mcpServers` block overrides the global `~/.claude/settings.json` where `infigraph install` wrote its config. Claude Code merges settings but project-level `mcpServers` takes precedence.

**Fix:** Run `infigraph install` from inside the project directory — or manually add the infigraph entry to the project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "infigraph": {
      "command": "/path/to/infigraph-mcp",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/infigraph-mcp` with the output of `which infigraph-mcp`. (`infigraph install` writes the same `args`.)

For the graph explorer UI separately: `infigraph-mcp --ui --port=9749` (see [Web UI](#web-ui)).

**Other causes:**
- Binary not found: verify `which infigraph-mcp` returns a path
- `infigraph install` failed silently during setup: re-run it manually and check for errors
- Invalid JSON in existing `settings.json`: fix the JSON, then re-run `infigraph install`

## Features

### Core
- **62 languages** — see full list below
- **LadybugDB graph database** — columnar embedded graph DB (Kuzu successor), full Cypher including WITH, OPTIONAL MATCH, variable-length paths, mutations
- **Hybrid search** — BM25 text ranking + Model2Vec neural embeddings (bundled, no network) with tunable alpha
- **HNSW vector index** — approximate nearest neighbor search for fast similarity queries at scale (~2ms for 500K symbols)
- **Embedding cache** — vectors saved to `.infigraph/embeddings.bin`, loaded on next search (first index = cache, subsequent = instant)
- **Cross-file call resolution** — import-aware resolution links function calls to actual definitions across files
- **Auto-watch** — file watcher auto-starts after indexing, keeps graph in sync via OS filesystem events with 500ms debounce
- **Session continuity** — persists session context (summary, pending tasks, decisions, touched files) across AI agent sessions
- **Docstring extraction** — captures docstrings/comments from AST, indexed for richer search
- **Function signatures** — extracts parameter lists and return types from AST for richer embeddings and search
- **Louvain community detection** — discovers functional modules/clusters in the call graph
- **Multi-repo groups** — group microservice repos, cross-repo Cypher queries, HTTP contracts, cross-service dependency detection
- **Custom edge types** — extensible relation system: language plugins can define custom edges (DECORATED_BY, SPAWNS, etc.) that persist in the graph
- **Gitignore-aware** — respects `.gitignore` and `.infigraphignore` patterns during indexing via the `ignore` crate
- **Learned resolution** — records successful cross-file call resolutions to improve accuracy on subsequent indexes
- **Structured ingestion** — TOML schema-driven data ingestion: define node tables, columns, edges in `.infigraph/structured-schemas/*.toml`. Ingest JSON/YAML files or entire directories. Edges can target the Symbol table with auto-resolution by name or ID. Both Kuzu and CozoDB backends
- **Named identity sessions** — `save_session` accepts `name` parameter to create named sessions (`named_{name}` IDs). `get_latest_session` accepts `name` to recall by identity. Named sessions stored separately from daily auto-saves
- **Skeleton annotations** — code skeleton includes quality metrics: `# complexity: N | nesting: N | stmts: N | fan-in: N` on functions/methods. Shared formatting between Kuzu and CozoDB
- **Write-lock concurrency safety** — advisory file locking (`flock`) for Kuzu single-writer constraint. All write paths protected — indexing, SCIP import, structured ingestion, cross-service linking, resolve. RAII guard auto-releases on drop or crash

### Analysis
- **Refactor analysis** — complexity hotspots, coupling (fan-in/fan-out), near-duplicate detection, dead code, file size — ranked by impact/effort
- **PR review** — auto-detects PR type (bug fix, refactor, migration, feature) and scope (standalone, cross-module, cross-repo). Runs: semantic diff, blast radius, affected tests, API surface changes, security scan, complexity delta, dead code, code clones, consistency checks. Set `group=` for cross-repo blast radius. Set `llm=true` for LLM-augmented review with test plan, risk assessment, and deployment notes
- **Test context generation** — `get_test_coverage` per file: covered %, list of uncovered symbols. `review` includes affected tests for changed symbols. Together they provide test context for AI agents to write targeted tests
- **CI check runner** — configurable checks (security, complexity, dead code, vuln scan) with pass/fail gates
- **OSV vulnerability scanning** — scans dependencies against the OSV database for known vulnerabilities
- **Design pattern detection** — identifies Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Builder, and other patterns
- **Taint analysis** — intra-procedural source→sink tracking + inter-procedural BFS through call graph (depth-limited). Sanitizer-aware false-positive reduction
- **Cross-cutting concern detection** — authorization, validation, caching, transactions, rate limiting, audit logging, feature flags, CORS, async, retry across Java/Python/TS/C#/Ruby/Go/Rust
- **Config binding resolution** — Spring profiles/qualifiers, Django settings, .NET appsettings, Rails envs, Go build tags, NestJS config
- **Reflection/dynamic invocation scanner** — Class.forName, ServiceLoader, getattr, importlib, dynamic require/import with config-file-based target resolution
- **Dynamic URL detection** — extracts URL templates from HTTP client calls (fetch, axios, requests, etc.), matches against known Route nodes
- **Path traversal detection** — multi-layer analysis combining intra+inter procedural taint with path-specific sanitizer awareness
- Dead code detection (uncalled functions/methods)
- Transitive impact / blast radius analysis
- Git diff → affected symbols mapping
- Architecture overview (language breakdown, hotspots, hub functions, entry points)
- HTTP route/endpoint detection across 22 languages (Flask, Express, Spring, Django, Gin, Actix, Phoenix, Rails, NestJS, and more)
- Cross-service HTTP dependency detection (`group deps`) — scans URL strings, matches to contracts across repos
- Bridge-to-call promotion — promotes detected cross-language bridges to CALLS edges for unified call graph analysis

### PR Review

Auto-detects PR type and scope, then runs a full analysis suite:

```
$ infigraph review                    # review last commit
$ infigraph review --base main        # review branch vs main
```

**What it runs automatically:**
- Semantic diff (added/removed/renamed/moved/changed symbols)
- Blast radius — all symbols transitively affected
- Affected tests — which test files cover changed symbols
- API surface changes — public symbol additions/removals
- Security scan — injection, secrets, eval, path traversal
- Complexity delta — did complexity increase?
- Dead code — did the change introduce unreachable code?
- Code clones — near-duplicate detection against changed symbols
- Consistency checks — naming, patterns

**MCP usage:**
```
review(path="/my/repo", base_ref="main")           # basic review
review(path="/my/repo", llm=true)                   # + LLM test plan & risk assessment
review(path="/my/repo", group="my-services")        # cross-repo blast radius
review(path="/my/repo", llm=true, dry_run=true)     # preview LLM prompt without calling API
```

### Test Context Generator

Two tools work together to generate test context for AI agents:

**`get_test_coverage`** — per-file analysis:
- Covered % (how many symbols have TESTED_BY edges)
- List of uncovered symbols with kind, line number, complexity
- Use before writing tests to find what needs coverage

**`review`** — affected tests for changed code:
- Maps changed symbols → test files that cover them
- Shows which tests need updating after a refactor
- Identifies new symbols that have zero test coverage

**Workflow — AI agent writing tests:**
1. `get_test_coverage(file="src/auth.py")` → see 3 of 8 functions untested
2. `symbol_context` on uncovered symbols → get signatures, callers, callees
3. Agent writes targeted tests for the 5 uncovered functions

**Workflow — PR review test plan:**
1. `review(llm=true)` → LLM generates test plan based on affected tests + uncovered symbols
2. Agent uses test plan to write tests for new/changed code

### Structured Ingestion

Define TOML schemas to ingest arbitrary JSON/YAML data into the graph:

```toml
# .infigraph/structured-schemas/api_endpoints.toml
schema_id = "api_endpoints"
name = "API Endpoints"
node_table = "Endpoint"

[[columns]]
name = "id"
col_type = "STRING"
primary = true

[[columns]]
name = "url"
col_type = "STRING"

[[columns]]
name = "method"
col_type = "STRING"

[[edges]]
name = "HANDLED_BY"
from_table = "Endpoint"
to_table = "Symbol"
from_column = "id"
to_column = "handler"
resolve_symbol = true  # auto-resolves handler names to Symbol nodes
```

Discovery paths: `.infigraph/structured-schemas/`, `.terragraph/schemas/`, `~/.infigraph/structured-schemas/`

```bash
# CLI usage
infigraph ingest --schema api_endpoints --data-file endpoints.json
infigraph ingest --schema api_endpoints --source ./data/endpoints/

# MCP tool
# tool: ingest_structured { schema_id: "api_endpoints", data_file: "endpoints.json" }
```

### CI Check Configuration

Configure quality gates via `check.toml`:

```toml
[security]
enabled = true
max_critical = 0
max_high = 5

[complexity]
enabled = true
threshold = 15
max_violations = 10

[dead_code]
enabled = true
max_dead = 20
```

### SCIP Integration (Compiler-grade Enrichment)
Infigraph natively imports [SCIP](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip) indexes to enrich the graph with precise compiler-grade symbols, types, and cross-file relationships. SCIP indexers are **auto-downloaded** — `infigraph index` detects project languages and fetches the right indexer binaries (with portable runtimes for Node.js, JRE, .NET, Dart, PHP) on first use:

```bash
# Generate SCIP index with an existing indexer
scip-typescript index --cwd .          # TypeScript/JavaScript
scip-python index --cwd .              # Python
scip-java index                        # Java/Kotlin
scip-go --cwd .                        # Go
# Then import into Infigraph
infigraph scip-import --index index.scip
```

**Languages with dedicated SCIP indexers:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust (rust-analyzer), C# (scip-dotnet), Ruby (scip-ruby), Scala

**Languages via lsp-to-scip bridge:** C/C++, Zig, Swift, Dart, Elixir, PHP, Lua, Haskell, F#, Clojure, Erlang, Perl, OCaml, and any language with an LSP server

#### lsp-to-scip Bridge

Generic tool that spawns any LSP server and generates `index.scip`:

```bash
# C/C++ via clangd
lsp-to-scip --server clangd --root /path/to/project --lang cpp

# Zig via zls
lsp-to-scip --server zls --root . --lang zig

# Swift via sourcekit-lsp
lsp-to-scip --server sourcekit-lsp --root . --lang swift

# Elixir via elixir-ls
lsp-to-scip --server "elixir-ls" --root . --lang elixir

# Dart
lsp-to-scip --server "dart language-server" --root . --lang dart

# Haskell
lsp-to-scip --server haskell-language-server-wrapper --root . --lang haskell

# F#
lsp-to-scip --server fsautocomplete --root . --lang fsharp

# Clojure
lsp-to-scip --server clojure-lsp --root . --lang clojure

# Erlang
lsp-to-scip --server erlang-ls --root . --lang erlang

# Then import
infigraph scip-import --index index.scip
```

## Graph Schema

### Nodes
- **Symbol** — functions, methods, classes, structs, enums, variables, constants, tests, sections, routes (with parameters, return_type, docstring, complexity)
- **Module** — file-level grouping
- **Cluster** — Louvain-detected community
- **File** — source file
- **Folder** — directory
- **Dependency** — external package dependency (name, version, ecosystem, is_dev)
- **Statement** — control flow statement (if/for/while/match) with kind, condition, depth
- **Concern** — cross-cutting concern (authorization, caching, transaction, etc.)
- **ConfigBinding** — configuration property binding (key, value, profile, source_file)

### Edges
- **CALLS** — function/method call (cross-file resolved + SCIP-enriched)
- **INHERITS** — class/interface inheritance
- **IMPLEMENTS** — interface implementation (from SCIP)
- **CONTAINS** — module contains symbol
- **TESTED_BY** — test function tests symbol
- **IMPORTS** — module imports module
- **READS** / **WRITES** — variable access
- **MEMBER_OF** — symbol belongs to cluster
- **SIMILAR_TO** — semantic similarity (embedding-based)
- **BRIDGE_TO** — cross-language bridge (FFI, JNI, gRPC, COM, WASM)
- **CALLS_SERVICE** — cross-service HTTP call (with method, path, target_service)
- **DEPENDS_ON** — module depends on external package
- **DEFINES** — file defines symbol
- **CONTAINS_FILE** — folder contains file
- **CONTAINS_FOLDER** — folder contains subfolder
- **HAS_CONCERN** — symbol has cross-cutting concern
- **HAS_CONFIG** — symbol has config binding
- **HAS_STATEMENT** — symbol contains control flow statement
- **RESOLVES_TO** — reflection/dynamic invocation resolves to target (with mechanism, config_source)
- **TAINT_FLOW** — dataflow from source to sink (with source_kind, sink_kind, path)
- **Custom edges** — extensible via language plugins (DECORATED_BY, SPAWNS, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — core engine
- **LadybugDB** (`lbug`) — embedded columnar graph database (Kuzu successor)
- **tree-sitter** 0.26 — AST parsing for 59 languages
- **Model2Vec** — neural embeddings (potion-base-8M, 256-dim, bundled — no proxy/network needed)
- **SCIP** — Sourcegraph Code Intelligence Protocol for compiler-grade enrichment
- **vis.js** — graph visualization
- **tiny_http** — embedded web server

## Contributing: Route & Decorator Extraction

Infigraph captures HTTP route decorators/attributes and stores them in symbol docstrings for semantic search. When a user searches "GET /api/users", the route-decorated function scores highest.

### How it works

Two mechanisms capture decorators:

1. **Tree-sitter query capture** (`entities.scm`) — for languages where decorators are syntactic wrappers (Python `decorated_definition`, Java annotation modifiers)
2. **AST sibling scan** (`extract/entities.rs`) — for languages where attributes are preceding sibling nodes (Rust `attribute_item`, C# `attribute_list`, Kotlin `annotation`, PHP `attribute_list`)

### HTTP Route Coverage

| Language | Framework examples | Status |
|----------|--------------------|--------|
| Python | Flask `@app.route`, FastAPI `@get`, Django `@api_view` | Working |
| Java | Spring `@GetMapping`, `@RequestMapping`, `@RestController` | Working |
| Rust | Actix `#[get]`, Axum, Rocket `#[get]` | Working |
| C# | ASP.NET `[HttpGet]`, `[Route]`, `[ApiController]` | Working |
| Kotlin | Spring `@GetMapping`, Ktor | Working |
| PHP | Laravel `#[Route]` (PHP 8+) | Working |
| TypeScript | NestJS `@Get()`, `@Controller()` | Working |
| JavaScript | Express `router.get("/path", ...)` | Working |
| Go | `r.GET("/path", handler)` (Gin, Chi, gorilla) | Working |
| Ruby | Rails `get "/path" do...end` | Working |
| Elixir | Phoenix `get "/path" do...end` | Working |
| Swift | Vapor `router.get("/path")` | Working |
| Dart | shelf `get("/path", handler)` | Working |
| Haskell | Servant `type API = "path" :> Get` | Working |
| Lua | Lapis `app:get("/path", ...)` | Working |
| Perl | Mojolicious `get "/path" => sub {...}` | Working |
| Clojure | Compojure `GET "/path"` | Working |
| Erlang | Cowboy `dispatch_rules` / `handle` | Working |
| GraphQL | Schema definitions | Working |
| Scala | Play `GET("path")` | Working |
| Django | `path("/url", view)` | Working |
| F# | Giraffe/Saturn (AST scan) | Deferred |

### Adding route support for a new language

#### Option A: Query-based (decorator-wrapper syntax)

Edit `crates/infigraph-languages/languages/<lang>/entities.scm`:

```scheme
; Capture route method, path, handler
(call_expression
  function: (identifier) @route.method
  arguments: (arguments
    (string_literal) @route.path)
  (#match? @route.method "^(get|post|put|delete|patch)$")) @route.def
```

#### Option B: AST sibling (attribute-preceded syntax)

Add the tree-sitter node kind to `ATTR_KINDS` in `crates/infigraph-core/src/extract/entities.rs`:

```rust
const ATTR_KINDS: &[&str] = &[
    "attribute_item",    // Rust
    "attribute_list",    // C#, PHP 8
    "annotation",        // Kotlin, Scala
    "decorator",         // TypeScript, JavaScript
    "marker_annotation", // Java
    // Add your language's attribute node kind here
];
```

### Test fixtures

`tests/fixtures/microservices/` contains realistic microservice repos for testing:
- `user-service/` — Python Flask (3 files, 6 routes)
- `order-service/` — TypeScript Express (4 files, 5 routes)
- `payment-service/` — Rust Actix-web (5 files, 4 routes)

## Documentation

The documentation site is built with Jekyll (Just the Docs theme) and deployed to GitHub Pages.

**To develop the docs locally:**
```bash
./scripts/setup-docs.sh  # One-time: copy branding assets
cd docs && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000/infigraph/` to view the site.

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed documentation setup instructions.

### Technical Deep Dives

- **[Code Parsing](docs/CODE-PARSING.md)** — How source code is parsed, symbols extracted, relationships mapped, and the graph built. Covers tree-sitter parsing, the grammar plugin system, all 62 languages, edge types, Kùzu storage, incremental indexing, embeddings, search, watch mode, route/contract extraction, and multi-repo groups.
- **[Document Indexing](docs/DOCUMENT-INDEXING.md)** — How documents are discovered, extracted, chunked, linked, and searched. Covers all supported formats (Markdown, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, RTF, XML), BFS crawling, link classification, cross-repo document linking, DocStore schema, hybrid search, and watch mode.
- **[Context Compression](docs/CONTEXT-COMPRESSION.md)** — How tool outputs are compressed (70–90% token savings): levels, config/`INFIGRAPH_*` env vars, optional kompress, session dedup, budget-aware `auto`, quality monitoring. Quick how-to also in [Context Compression](#context-compression) above.
